<p align="center">XVAPI is an API wrapper for the Celery Roblox executor. 
It was made without any malicious code and is free to use and open source. 
You can use it for your awesome exploit GUIs. At the time of writing this, XVAPI is undetected because it is built on top of Celery's existing inject and code execution functions.
Enjoy, and I hope to see some cool GUIs.</p>
